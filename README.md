# Image Data Toolkit
Welcome to the *Image Data Toolkit*! This project is a collection of tools that allow users to edit and manipulate image metadata. With these tools, users can generate keywords for their images, attach those keywords to the EXIF metadata, and even convert between different image formats.

**Technologies**\
This project utilizes a combination of *Python* and *JavaScript* as its primary technologies. In addition to these core technologies, we also integrated the Microsoft Azure API and the Adobe Stock API to enhance the functionality and capabilities of the project. 

**Challenges**\
During the development of this project, we encountered several challenges. One such challenge was that EXIF data is stored in the metadata of an image file, and certain operating systems or software programs do not support the editing or modification of metadata. This led to conflicts and errors when attempting to import images whose EXIF data had been edited.

Additionally, it's worth noting that some image file formats do not support the storage of EXIF data. In these cases, it was not possible to edit the EXIF data of an image, regardless of the operating system or software being used.
