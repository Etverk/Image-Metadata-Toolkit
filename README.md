## About
Welcome to the *Image Metadata Toolkit*! This project is a collection of tools that allow users to edit and manipulate image metadata. With these tools, users can generate keywords for their images, attach those keywords to the EXIF metadata, and even convert between different image formats.

**Technologies**\
This project utilizes a combination of *Python* and *JavaScript* as its primary technologies. In addition to these core technologies, we also integrated the Microsoft Azure API and the Adobe Stock API to enhance the functionality and capabilities of the project. 

**Challenges**\
During the development of this project, we encountered several challenges. One such challenge was that EXIF data is stored in the metadata of an image file, and certain operating systems or software programs do not support the editing or modification of metadata. This led to conflicts and errors when attempting to import images whose EXIF data had been edited.

Additionally, it's worth noting that some image file formats do not support the storage of EXIF data. In these cases, it was not possible to edit the EXIF data of an image, regardless of the operating system or software being used.

## Toolkit

### Keyword Generator
The Keyword Generator is a tool designed to generate a comprehensive list of keywords. The program allows users to generate either random keywords or keywords related to a specific term of their choice, using the Adobe Stock API to gather data. The resulting keywords are outputted in an EXIF format, with semi-colons used to separate the keywords and each line representing a group of keywords related to a specific topic. This program can be a useful resource for anyone looking to generate a large list of keywords for a variety of purposes, such as keyword research or content optimization.

### Image Meta Tagger
The Image Meta Tagger is a tool that enables users to add EXIF data, specifically XPKeywords, to images. This program utilizes the list of keywords generated by The Keyword Generator and allows users to attach keywords to images based on the name of the image file in the operating system. With the Image Meta Tagger, users can easily add relevant and descriptive keywords to their images, making them more searchable and easily organized. This program can be a valuable resource for photographers, designers, and other professionals looking to effectively tag and manage their digital image collection.

### Image Format Converter
The Image Format Converter is a tool that allows users to convert an image to a different format, as specified by the user. This program is particularly useful for situations in which an image needs to be converted to a specific format in order to meet certain requirements or be compatible with certain software. For instance, the Image Format Converter can be used to convert PNG images to JPG format. With this program, users can easily and quickly convert images to a variety of different formats, making it a valuable resource for anyone working with digital images.

### Image Describer
The Image Describer is a tool that allows users to generate a one-sentence description of a provided image, using the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. The generated description is attached to the image's EXIF data as the XPTitle, making it easily accessible and searchable. The Image Describer is a valuable resource for photographers, designers, and other professionals looking to swiftly add titles to their images.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
You need to have a machine with [Python](https://www.python.org/) > 3.10.6 and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) > 18.12.1.
```
$ python -V
Python 3.10.6

$ node -v
v18.12.1
```
You will also need to setup the following:
* [Adobe Stock API](https://developer.adobe.com/stock/docs/getting-started/): This API is used by KeywordGenerator.js to generate keyword lists.
* [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Canomaly-detector%2Clanguage-service%2Ccomputer-vision%2Cwindows): This API is used by ImageDescriber.py to describe images with AI.

To install the packages used by Python and JavaScript, run the following commands using [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
```
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision msrest Pillow exif python-dotenv
```
```
npm i random-words request dotenv
```

## Running locally

### Configuration
There is a file named ".env.example" with the following structure.
1. Locally rename the file from ".env.example" to ".env".
2. Replace the information in the curly brackets with your own data.
3. Remove the curly brackets sorrounding the data.

```env
#KeywordGenerator:
    AdobeAPIKey = {key}
    NumberOfIterations = {num}
    SearchKeyword = {keyword}

#ImageMetaTagger:
    ImageMetaTaggerImportFolder = {path}
    ImageMetaTaggerExportFolder = {path}

#ImageFormatConverter:
    ImageFormatConverterImportFormat = {format}
    ImageFormatConverterExportFormat = {format}
    ImageFormatConverterImportFolder = {path}
    ImageFormatConverterExportFolder = {path}

#ImageDescriber:
    AzureSubscriptionKey = {key}
    AzureEndpoint = {endpoint}
    ImageDescriberImportFolder = {path}
    ImageDescriberExportFolder = {path}
```
